## Overview

  This project is build with HTML and Sass CSS preprocessor. This is the first time I used Sass and I was able to create reusable CSS variables and implement CSS selector nesting to target specific elements while making CSS code shorter.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
- Use one of the CSS preprocessors (Sass, Less, Stylus, etc)

## My process

To use Sass, I first read its documentation and learned the basics. Afterwards, I proceeded to build the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use Sass. I was able to apply CSS selector nesting to target specific elements in my HTML and create variables to setup my project theme and use it throughout my project.

### Continued development

To improve this project, I will dig deeper in Sass and then refactor my input.scss file to follow the best practices and apply other Sass techniques if possible.

### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - This helped me understand Sass and apply it in this project
